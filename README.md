Web Development final project

RESTful, database-backed web application, inspired by Goodreads, implements user model with sign-in/sign-up/sign-out, ‘forgot password’ functionality, and optional OAuth login. Users can explore books, add new ones, and review them. 

Accessed by cloning the repository, migrating and seeding the database, and running a local rails server on port 3000. Then go to
http://localhost:3000/
