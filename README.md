My app is called Bookster and is similar to Goodreads. Users can explore books, add new ones, and review them.

The idea I submitted for the milestone was essentially wikipedia for NASA, but I was having trouble acquiring the data and getting a grasp on the scope of what I was trying to build. Hence, the change to this book app.
